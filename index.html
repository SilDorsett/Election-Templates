This @@Label@@, The North Pacific will be electing [[a Delegate,]] [[a]] [[Vice Delegate,]] [[and]] [[Speaker,]] [[#]][[a]] [[Justice]][[s]][[,]] [[and]] [[an Attorney General]] to serve until the next election in [[NextSched]]. Any Citizen who has been a member for the last 15 days (since @@EligibilityDate@@) is eligible to run for these offices [[excepting that @@TermLimitedDelegate@@ is unable to run for Delegate due to term limitations]], and eligible members may run for more than one of these offices if they so wish. Loss of Citizenship before the conclusion of this election will also result in loss of eligibility to run for any office during this election. [[A list of those eligible to run is provided below.]]

To run, one must either accept a nomination or declare candidacy [u]in this thread[/u]. To withdraw from running, one must post a withdrawal of candidacy in [u]this thread[/u]. 

Acceptances of nominations, declarations of candidacy, and withdrawals of candidacy posted outside this thread will be discounted. Acceptance of a nomination is understood to also constitute declaration of candidacy even if no nomination has been made. Acceptances of nominations, declarations of candidacy, and withdrawals of candidacy must be posted during the candidacy declaration period to be valid. The candidacy declaration period is from (time=@@CandidaciesOpen@@) (your forum time) to (time=@@CandidaciesEnd@@) (your forum time). Voting will be approximately from (time=@@VotingOpen@@) (your forum time) to (time=@@VotingEnd@@) (your forum time).

This topic is intended for nominations, acceptances of nominations, declarations of candidacy, and withdrawals of candidacy; it may not be used for campaigning. Please keep in mind that lying about the election is election fraud, and that lying for any purpose is fraud.

Voting [[is now open]][[opens at (time=@@VotingOpen@@)]] in this @@Type@@. Voting will be from (time=@@VotingOpen@@) (your forum time) to (time=@@VotingEnd@@) (your forum time), and ballots submitted outside that time are invalid. 

Everyone who is a Citizen at the time voting opens is eligible to vote. Loss of Citizenship before the close of voting also results in loss of eligibility to vote.

Public Voters must use the following voting form:

[[[b]Would you like to reopen nominations?[/b] &lt; Yes | No &gt;]]

[[[b]Vice Delegate:[/b] &lt; @@Options@@ &gt;]]

[[[b][color=red]Abstain is a candidate in this election. If you wish to abstain from voting you must use the option of PRESENT.[/color][/b]]]

Voters may submit their ballots either publicly by a post in this thread, or through personal message to [url=http://forum.thenorthpacific.org/msg/?c=2&amp;mid=197430]The Voting Booth[/url] with a [url=https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&amp;min=1&amp;max=10000&amp;col=1&amp;base=10&amp;format=html&amp;rnd=new]random[/url] ballot ID number, using the below form. The ballot ID number will be posted together with your vote but with no reference to your identity so that you can verify that we posted your vote and any votes otherwise identical to yours, separately.

Ballots not submitted according to these guidelines are invalid. Ambiguous votes are invalid.

[b][color=red]Election Commissioners are required by law to announce private votes in the voting thread, including the candidate(s) the vote was cast for, promptly after those votes are cast. To allow voters to verify their vote is individually counted, the Election Commission will also be including the ballot ID number. For this reason, voters are discouraged from announcing, as was custom, that they have voted privately, as the subsequent public declaration by the Election Commissioners can potentially reveal how they voted.[/color][/b]

Please do not post anything other than your ballot in this thread. If you have any questions please send them directly to [url=http://forum.thenorthpacific.org/msg/?c=2&amp;mid=197430]The Voting Booth[/url] or start a new thread. Additional and unnecessary comments will be removed.

<p>The Election Commission is required to announce all private ballots in the Voting topic in a timely manner. It is recommended that each such ballot is announced in a separate post, to facilitate counting. Below is a template that can be used for such posts:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can copy the counting template by opening it, clicking the File menu in the upper left hand corner, and clicking "Make a copy..."</li>
<li>It is generally advisable to share the counting sheet with all Election Commissioners.</li>
<li>To update the copy of the template for the current election:

<ol>
<li>Remove the sheets for other types of elections (click the triangle next to the sheet name, then click Delete). </li>
<li>Update the set of candidates in the Results sheet.</li>
<li>If more candidates are needed than there are spaces, the macros will need to be adjusted. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="instructions-for-counting" class="anchor" href="#instructions-for-counting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructions for counting</h3>

<ol>
<li>For every public vote, one can enter the voter's forum name, a link to their ballot, and their votes (as well as any notes if needed) in the Ballots sheet in the appropriate columns.</li>
<li>For every private vote, one can do the same in the Ballots sheet, but exclude the voter's forum name. The names of private voters may <em>never</em> be published. In this case, the link should be to the post where the private ballot was announced by the Election Commissioners.</li>
<li>Check the Ballots sheet for invalid votes. A vote may be invalid because the person who cast it  was not or is no longer an eligible voter. Eligible voters are those that are Citizens throughout <em>the entire time</em> the vote is open. Ways to confirm this include checking that voters are in the Citizens usergroup as they vote, as well as checking against the official <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjUCYljFPq3CdEtwc19aNTZJMWszeWhrcm1tOFdLcWc#gid=0">Citizen / Resident Registry</a> maintained by the Speaker's Office. It is important to keep in mind that Citizenship status changes take effect the moment they are announced by the Speaker's Office. For this reason, ultimately, Citizenship status can be definitively verified only by tracking recent Citizenship <a href="http://forum.thenorthpacific.org/topic/7306731/1/">admissions</a> and <a href="http://forum.thenorthpacific.org/topic/6917173/1/">removals</a>.</li>
<li>Invalid votes can be invalidated by deleting the votes choices and turning their background color to red.</li>
<li>It is advisable to inform invalid voters that their vote is invalid in shortly after they cast it, allowing them to correct any errors if possible.</li>
</ol>

<a id="important-note-regarding-private-votes" class="anchor" href="#important-note-regarding-private-votes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Important Note regarding Private Votes</h2>

<p>It is important to make sure that the published spreadsheet:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lists all private votes.</li>
<li>Does <em>not</em> list the names of the corresponding voters.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the election is concluded, it is generally advisable to put all private ballot PMs into a folder, to afford future Election Commissions a clean working environment.</p>

<p>A Results post must cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>That the votes have been counted.</li>
<li>How many votes were counted for each candidate, and how many abstained.</li>
<li>Which publicly posted votes (including private ballots announced by Election Commissioners in an anonymized manner) were invalid, if any (this can be addressed by inserting a note using the BBCode [note] tag following the affected total, or by adding a separate paragraph).</li>
<li>Who, if anyone, is elected to which position.</li>
<li>Whether a runoff will be held.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: A note to our successor Election Commission</p>

<p><strong>Body</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>To the next Election Commission,

It has been our experience that the operation of elections in The North Pacific requires great care to avoid being unfair in one direction or another and ensure democracy functions. To assist future Election Commissions in taking such appropriate care, we pass on a set of [url=https://github.com/The-North-Pacific/Election-Templates]Templates[/url] and instructions. We recommend that as your first act, you adopt the protocol that actions following these instructions may be taken by any Election Commissioner individually (to save time) but any deviation from them should be voted on (to reduce the risk of error).

Regards,
~The Previous Election Commission
</code></pre>

<p>If any part of this manual did not meet the needs of you or your Election Commission as a whole, please suggest improvements. The canonical way to do so is via a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a> but if that's not your piece of cake, just PM one of the people who <em>would</em> do that. Any change requested by an Election Commission will be made.</p>
